# Resume Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Resume

To add your resume to the portfolio:

1. **Prepare your resume**: Save your resume as a PDF file
2. **Name it correctly**: Name the file `resume.pdf`
3. **Place it in the right location**: Put the file in the `public/` directory
4. **File path**: The final path should be `public/resume.pdf`

## How it works

- The resume button on the homepage will automatically link to `/resume.pdf`
- When clicked, it will open your resume in a new tab
- The button has a green color to distinguish it from other buttons

## Example

```
your-portfolio/
├── public/
│   ├── resume.pdf  ← Your resume goes here
│   ├── images/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The resume button is already implemented and will work once you add your PDF file!
